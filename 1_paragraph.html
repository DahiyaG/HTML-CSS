        As far as i can tell the problem resides in the lenght of the paragraphs.
        Is there any way to fix the behavior?

        I've been <strong>struggling</strong> with a specific article with very long paragraphs.
        When i preview the epub file using calibre and <i>ADE</i> there's absolutely
        no problem, but when i test it in my Kobo Glo i find several arbitrary
        breaks, sometimes in the middle of the screen. As far as i can tell the
        problem resides in the lenght of the paragraphs. Is there any way to
        fix the behavior?
