            <p>I've been struggling with a specific article with very long paragraphs.
                When i preview the epub file using calibre and ADE there's absolutely
                no problem, but when i test it in my Kobo Glo i find several arbitrary
                breaks, sometimes in the middle of the screen. As far as i can tell the
                problem resides in the lenght of the paragraphs. Is there any way to
                fix the behavior?
            </p>
